# BroodWarLib
Starcraft BroodWar Library and Unit Testing framework

## BWLib
The BroodWar Library contains structures and functions useful to not only BWAPI, but also other projects that intend to interact with StarCraft: BroodWar, such as GPTP, Teippi and others.

The intention is to include universal data structures and enumerations only, excluding offsets and hooking methods. This ensures that this code can be used outside of Broodwar.
